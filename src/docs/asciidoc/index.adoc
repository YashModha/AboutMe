== Projects

=== Machine learning to aid mental health among youth during COVID-19 – Chatbot

This research presents a comparative study of specialized deep learning and state of the art machine learning approaches
for multiclass classification of six emotions: **joy, sadness, surprise, fear, love, anger**. Specialized deep learning
algorithm **Bi-LSTM**; state of the art **H2O ANN**; traditional SVM and state of the art H2O Gradient Boosting Machines
are applied on vectorised text. Cross validated performance using different vectorization techniques: text to sequences,
word to vectors and TF-IDF are presented. The specialized Bi-LSTM on text to sequence vectorised data outperforms SVM
and both outperform H2O ANN. A Gradient Boosted Machine age classifier is used to stratify test data. The traditional
TF-IDF applied SVM outperforms the Bi-LSTM model on both Youth and Adult test data. The research is further extended
to present a chatbot deployment of the emotion classifier by creating a **Flask API**.

=== Smart Waste Management in Cities using Internet of Things

Ultrasonic Sensor Detects the level of garbage in Dustbin and sends the data via an SMS to the authorities using a
**GSM** module, along with this the Dustbin also sends the data dynamically to an app via Internet which shows live
level of Dustbin. This project helps in saving fuel as the authorities do not need to go at the location where the
Dustbins are not filled.
